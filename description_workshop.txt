Apacchii's Classes: Reborn is the successor to my first ever mod "Apacchii's Classes Mod" (Now known as "Apacchii's Classes: Classic").
This mod focuses solely on the classes and is completely reimagined and hopefully more balanced.

Features:
- 6 Classes (as of now)
- Daily Quests
- As many levels as bosses you have in your playthrough. (Can be capped)
- A dedicated accessory slot for classes.
- A unique talent tree for each class.
- A 'roguelike' system where you build your deck of runes which grant small boosts.
- A relic system with lots of different relics.
- A dedicated accessory slot for relics.
- Play the way you want! Highly customizable game/mod balancing via mod configuration.
- Partial localization support.

[Mod Configuration allows you to change how many stats you get from classes, how much damage/health enemies have/deal and much more, please take a look at them if you want to balance things out yourself]

As of now there are 6 classes.
Each class has at least 1 passive ability, 2 active abilities, 1 ultimate ability, and a unique Talent Tree specific for that class.

Classes level up automatically each time a boss is defeated and the levels are player and class-sided, which means your classes will all progress individually per character.
The class' max level is as high as the amount of bosses you have in the game, including modded.

Dont forget to bind your mod keybinds!

Thanks #Sylvium for helping out with some sprites!
