Freatures:
- 7 Classes (as of now)
- As many levels as bosses you have in your playthrough (can be capped)
- A dedicated accessory slot for classes
- A unique talent tree for each class
- A unique specialization tree for each class
- A relic system with lots of different relics
- A dedicated accessory slot for relics
- Highly customizable game/mod balancing via mod configuration
- Partial localization support (need translators)

(Mod Configuration allows you to change how many stats you get from classes, how much damage/health enemies have/deal and much more, please take a look at them if you want to balance things out yourself)

As of now there are 7 classes.
Each class has at least 1 passive ability, 2 active abilities, 1 ultimate ability, and 1 talent tree specific for that class.

Classes level up automatically each time a boss is defeated and the levels are player and class-sided, which means your classes will all progress individually per character.
The class' max level is as high as the amount of bosses you have in the game, including modded.



Dont forget to bind your mod keybinds!
