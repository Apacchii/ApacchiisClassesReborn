Apacchii's Classes: Reborn is the successor to my first ever mod "Apacchii's Classes Mod" (Now known as "Apacchii's Classes: Classic").
This mod focuses solely on the classes and is completely reimagined and hopefully more balanced.

-> BETA VERSION, NOT ALL FEATURES ARE IMPLEMENTED YET <-

Freatures:
- 4 Classes (as of now)
- As many levels as bosses you have in your playthrough (can be capped)
- A dedicated slot for classes
- A unique talent tree for each class
- A relic system with lots of different relics
- A dedicated slot for relics
- Highly customizable game/mod balancing via mod configuration

As of now there are 4 classes, 1 for each vanilla damage type.
Each class has 1 passive ability, 2 active abilities, 1 ultimate ability and a Talent Tree specific for that class.

Classes level up automatically each time a boss is defeated and the levels are player and class-sided.
The class' max level is as high as the amount of bosses you have in the game, including modded.

Dont forget to bind your mod keybinds!

--- If you enjoy this mod, please consider giving the steam workshop page a like, have fun! ---
